# cowsGame
This is simple game for web browser. Main goal for me is to learn react and node and build my first web page for publish. It is also scientific work for my university
So, goals are:
1. Safe web page for users' information
2. As fast as possible. Fast work not only for web but for me! >~<
3. Interesting concept. (I also live link here later)
4. I hope this could be good project for my summary
